Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
I take this course because coding is something that is important for my future life. I'm looking forward to learn the basic concept of coding that are enough to cover up basic life problems.

What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.
Feeding Frenzy is the game that I intrested the most. I really want to design that kind of game and making those cool animations like how the fish turns and eat smaller fishes. Last year I wrote a similar based on it but it was not really successful. This year I hope I could make it better and make the game working on.
